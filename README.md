# ADoerable

I tried to build a small concept of a apparel shop witha  gruesome twist. I tried to get Copilot to build a pixel image of a deer. When clicked on, the deer turns red as it has been shot, and loads the shop.

This is a simple prototype, but showed how the AI does not have direct access to what we call the "color wheel". This reminds me that AI does not have access to "life context", or things that we have directly experienced, they need it to be explained like are a growing child.
